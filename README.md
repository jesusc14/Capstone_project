# Capstone Project - Metro Data Web App
This is a capstone project analyzing transit data and visualizing it can involve gathering and 
processing data from various sources, such as transit authorities or third-party providers.

Created By: Daniel Prasetyo, Jesus Eduardo Celestino, Mariama Abdi, and Brandon Vuong.

The purpose of this web app is to provide users with comprehensive analyses of public transit routes and efficient planning tools, 
including the visualization of graphs depicting multiple different routes. By utilizing the GTFS-to-HTML tool and incorporating data visualization capabilities, 
the web app offers users valuable insights into transit routes and facilitates informed decision-making.

The web app utilizes the GTFS-to-HTML tool to generate user-friendly interfaces that allow users to access and explore detailed information 
about various public transit routes. Users can easily navigate through the app to view route maps, schedules, and stop locations, 
enabling them to plan their trips effectively.

In addition to route information, the web app leverages data visualization techniques to present graphs that illustrate multiple different routes. 
These graphs provide users with a visual representation of the transit network, allowing them to compare and analyze various routes in terms of 
factors such as travel time, frequency, and connectivity. By visualizing the data, the web app simplifies complex information and enables users to 
make informed decisions about their travel routes.

Overall, the web app serves as a comprehensive platform that combines route information, 
efficient trip planning tools, and graphical representations of multiple transit routes. 
By utilizing the GTFS-to-HTML tool and incorporating data visualization, it empowers users to access detailed 
route information, plan their trips efficiently, and make informed decisions based on visualized comparisons of different routes.
